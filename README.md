# CRC using SSFT

This project focuses on implementing Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), a widely used error-detection technique in digital communication systems and data storage. CRC enables reliable data transfer by detecting accidental changes, noise, or corruption in transmitted messages. The project demonstrates how binary messages can be encoded using a generator polynomial to produce a unique checksum, which is then appended to the data. At the receiving end, the same polynomial logic is applied to verify data integrity and identify transmission errors. The pulse propagation is done using the Split-Step Fourier Transform in a non-linear and dispersive medium.
